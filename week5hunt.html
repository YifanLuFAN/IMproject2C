            <p>Kusama is known as the Queen of Polka Dots, and I also tried to create with polka dots. I first selected a color range, then mixed it freely with watercolor paint, and made sure that the colors produced were within the color range. Then I randomly drew circles on the picture, and it didn't matter if the colors were mixed together, and thus created this dot painting.</p>

            <p>SLAVE TO THE ALGORITHM.I bought an ordinary six-sided die as a prop to determine my fate. First, I used the numbers 1-6 to represent 8:00-10:30 (half an hour and one point), and rolled the dice the night before to determine my wake-up time. Fortunately, I was able to sleep in until 10 o'clock. After that, I numbered my clothes, pants, and shoes, and used the dice to decide what to wear when going out. As a result, I was wearing all black (what a coincidence!). Of course, my lunch and dinner were also determined by the dice, and then I had McDonald's for lunch and pizza for dinner (high in calories!)</p>
